## Usage

### Basic Configuration

Add the card to your Lovelace dashboard:

```yaml
type: custom:skylight-calendar-card
title: Family Calendar
entities:
  - calendar.personal

```

### Advanced Configuration

```yaml
type: custom:skylight-calendar-card
title: Family Calendar
entities:
  - calendar.personal
  - calendar.work
  - calendar.family
  - calendar.kids_activities
default_view: week-standard  # Load this view by default
header_color: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3a8a 0%, #3b82f6 100%)'  # Custom blue gradient
first_day_of_week: 0  # 0 = Sunday, 1 = Monday, etc.
show_week_numbers: false
max_events: 100
view_mode: month  # 'month', 'week-compact', or 'week-standard'
week_days: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]  # Days to show in week views (0=Sun, 6=Sat)
week_start_hour: 8  # Start hour for week-standard view
week_end_hour: 21   # End hour for week-standard view (9pm = 21)
height_scale: 0.6   # Make schedule more compact (50-200%)
compact_height: true  # Fit to screen with scrolling
compact_header: true  # Single-row header layout
enable_event_management: true  # Enable event creation (default: true)

## Calendar Entity Setup

This card requires Home Assistant calendar entities. You can integrate calendars from:

- **Google Calendar**: [Integration Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google/)
- **CalDAV** (Apple Calendar, Nextcloud, etc.): [Integration Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/caldav/)
- **Local Calendar**: [Integration Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/local_calendar/)
- **Office 365**: [Integration Guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/microsoft/)

After setting up the integration, calendar entities will be automatically created (e.g., `calendar.personal`, `calendar.work`).

## Features in Detail

### View Modes

The card supports three different view modes that you can switch between using the buttons in the header:

#### Month View
The traditional calendar grid showing a full month at a time. Events are displayed as color-coded blocks within each day. Perfect for getting an overview of the entire month.

```yaml
view_mode: month
```

#### Week Compact View
Shows each day of the week as a column with events stacked vertically. This view is ideal for seeing all your week's events at a glance without the detailed timeline. You can configure which days to show:

```yaml
view_mode: week-compact
week_days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Monday-Friday only
```

#### Week Standard (Schedule) View
Displays a detailed timeline view with hours on the left and days across the top. Events are positioned at their exact time slots. Perfect for detailed day planning:

```yaml
view_mode: week-standard
week_start_hour: 8   # Start at 8am
week_end_hour: 21    # End at 9pm
week_days: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # Weekdays only
```

### Color-Coded Events

Each calendar entity can have its own color, making it easy to distinguish between different types of events:

```yaml
colors:
  calendar.personal: '#FF6B6B'    # Red for personal events
  calendar.work: '#4ECDC4'        # Teal for work events
  calendar.family: '#45B7D1'      # Blue for family events
  calendar.kids: '#FFA07A'        # Orange for kids' activities
```

### Customizing Header Color

By default, the header automatically matches your Home Assistant theme's primary color using `var(--primary-color)`. You can override this with any custom color or gradient:

**Solid Colors:**
```yaml
header_color: '#1e40af'  # Solid blue
header_color: '#059669'  # Solid green
header_color: '#dc2626'  # Solid red
```

**Gradients:**
```yaml
# Blue gradient
header_color: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3a8a 0%, #3b82f6 100%)'

# Green gradient
header_color: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #065f46 0%, #10b981 100%)'

# Orange/Red gradient
header_color: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #ea580c 0%, #dc2626 100%)'

# Teal gradient
header_color: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #0f766e 0%, #14b8a6 100%)'

# Classic purple gradient (original default)
header_color: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)'
```

**Use Other Theme Variables:**
```yaml
# Use secondary color
header_color: 'var(--secondary-color)'

# Use accent color
header_color: 'var(--accent-color)'

# Dark background
header_color: 'var(--card-background-color)'
```

**Restore Default:**
```yaml
# Explicitly set to match theme (this is already the default)
header_color: 'var(--primary-color)'
```

### Event Details Modal

Click on any event to see:
- Event title
- Description
- Start and end time
- Location (if specified)

### Day View

Click on any day to see all events for that day in an organized list.

### Today Highlight

The current day is automatically highlighted with a blue background and the date number is shown in a blue circle.

### Navigation

- Click the arrow buttons to move between months
- Click "Today" to jump back to the current month

## Event Management

### Creating Events

The card now supports creating events directly from the calendar interface! This feature works with most calendar integrations including Local Calendar, Google Calendar, CalDAV, and Office 365.

**Three Ways to Create Events:**

1. **"+ Add Event" Button** - Click the button in the header to create an event
2. **Click on a Day** - In month or week views, click on any day to create an event on that date
3. **Click on a Time Slot** - In schedule view, click on a specific time to create an event at that exact time

**Event Creation Form:**

The event creation modal includes:
- **Calendar Selection** - Choose which calendar to add the event to (only writable calendars shown)
- **Event Title** (required) - Name of your event
- **All-Day Toggle** - Switch between all-day events and timed events
- **Start/End Time** - For timed events, select exact start and end times
- **Start/End Date** - For all-day events, select the date range
  - Example: Single-day event on Feb 4 → Start: Feb 4, End: Feb 4
  - Example: Two-day event (Feb 4-5) → Start: Feb 4, End: Feb 5
  - Example: Three-day event (Feb 4-6) → Start: Feb 4, End: Feb 6
- **Location** - Optional location field
- **Description** - Optional detailed description

**Smart Defaults:**

- When clicking a day, the event defaults to that date
- When clicking a time slot in schedule view, the event defaults to that exact time
- Timed events default to 1-hour duration
- Times are automatically rounded to the nearest 30 minutes

### Editing Events

Click on any event to view its details, then click the **"Edit"** button to modify it.

**What You Can Edit:**
- Change event title, location, and description
- Modify start and end times/dates
- Switch between all-day and timed events
- Move event to a different calendar

**How It Works:**
- If the calendar supports the UPDATE service, changes are applied directly
- Otherwise, the event is automatically deleted and recreated with new details
- All editing is seamless - you don't need to know which method is used!

**Moving Events Between Calendars:**
You can change which calendar an event belongs to by selecting a different calendar in the dropdown. The event will be removed from the old calendar and created in the new one.

### Deleting Events

Click on any event and click the **"Delete"** button to remove it.

**Simple Deletion:**
For non-recurring events, you'll see a confirmation dialog. Click "Delete" to confirm.

**Recurring Event Deletion:**
For recurring events, you have three options:

1. **This event only** - Delete just this one occurrence
2. **This and future events** - Delete this occurrence and all future occurrences
3. **All events** - Delete the entire recurring series

**Example Scenarios:**
- Weekly team meeting but you're on vacation next week → Choose "This event only"
- Weekly meeting changing to bi-weekly starting today → Choose "This and future events"
- Project cancelled, remove all project meetings → Choose "All events"

**Example Configuration with Full Event Management:**

```yaml
type: custom:skylight-calendar-card
title: Family Calendar
entities:
  - calendar.personal      # Writable - can create, edit, delete
  - calendar.work          # Writable - can create, edit, delete
  - calendar.holidays      # Read-only
enable_event_management: true
readonly_calendars:
  - calendar.holidays  # Prevent creating/editing/deleting events on holidays calendar
```

### Calendar Integration Compatibility

**Full Support (Create, Edit, Delete):**
- ✅ **Local Calendar** - Full support with delete+create fallback for edits
- ⚠️ **CalDAV** - Support varies by server (Nextcloud, iCloud, etc.)
- ⚠️ **Office 365** - Create works; edit/delete support varies

**Limited Support (Create Only):**
- ⚠️ **Google Calendar** - **Create works**, but **edit/delete NOT supported** through Home Assistant
  - **Why?** The Google Calendar integration doesn't expose the UPDATE/DELETE services
  - **Workaround:** Use the Google Calendar app or website to edit/delete events
  - Events created through this card can still be viewed in Home Assistant
  - You'll see an informational message when viewing Google Calendar events

**How Editing Works (Non-Google Calendars):**
1. **UPDATE Service Available** - Event is modified directly (fastest, preserves UID)
2. **Fallback Method** - Event is deleted and recreated (works on calendars with delete+create)

**How Deletion Works (Non-Google Calendars):**
- Uses the `calendar.delete_event` service
- Only available if calendar integration supports deletion
- Delete button is automatically hidden for calendars that don't support it

**Note:** The card automatically detects which operations each calendar supports and shows/hides buttons accordingly. If you don't see an Edit or Delete button, your calendar integration doesn't support those operations or the event is missing required information (UID).

### Disabling Event Management

If you want a read-only calendar view:

```yaml
type: custom:skylight-calendar-card
title: Family Calendar (Read-Only)
entities:
  - calendar.personal
enable_event_management: false  # Disable all event management features
```

Or mark specific calendars as read-only:

```yaml
type: custom:skylight-calendar-card
title: Family Calendar
entities:
  - calendar.personal
  - calendar.holidays
readonly_calendars:
  - calendar.holidays  # Can view but not create events on holidays calendar
```

## Tips and Tricks

### Organizing Family Schedules

Create separate calendars for different family members:

```yaml
entities:
  - calendar.mom
  - calendar.dad
  - calendar.kid1
  - calendar.kid2
  - calendar.family_shared
```

### Color Coding by Category

Use colors to represent different types of activities:

```yaml
colors:
  calendar.appointments: '#FF6B6B'  # Red for appointments
  calendar.sports: '#4ECDC4'        # Teal for sports
  calendar.school: '#FFA07A'        # Orange for school
  calendar.social: '#98D8C8'        # Green for social events
```

### Adjusting Height for Different Screens

**Make it more compact:**
```yaml
height_scale: 0.7  # 70% of default height
```

**Make it larger:**
```yaml
height_scale: 1.5  # 150% of default height
```

**Fit to screen with scrolling:**
```yaml
compact_height: true  # Fits to viewport height
```

**Combine for best results:**
```yaml
height_scale: 0.6
compact_height: true
# Creates a compact view that fits perfectly in the available space
```

### Using Rolling Days Mode

Perfect for dynamic date ranges that don't follow calendar weeks:

```yaml
# Show next 3 days
rolling_days: 2  # Today + 2 = 3 days

# Show next 10 days
rolling_days: 9  # Today + 9 = 10 days

# Show just today
rolling_days: 0  # Today only
```

Navigation buttons will advance by the number of days shown (rolling_days + 1).

### Setting Default View

Load the card in your preferred view automatically:

```yaml
default_view: 'week-standard'  # Always open in schedule view
```

This is especially useful when you primarily use one view mode but want the ability to switch to others.

### Compact Header Mode

Save vertical space with the single-row header:

```yaml
compact_header: true
```

This shows the title, calendar badges, and view controls all in one row, perfect for smaller screens or when maximizing calendar space.

### Interactive Features

- **Click calendar badges** at the top to show/hide that calendar's events
- **Click any event** to see full details including duration, location, description, and attendees
- **Click days or time slots** to create new events (when event management is enabled)
- **Click "+ Add Event"** button for quick event creation

### Multiple Cards

You can add multiple cards for different views:
- One for the whole family
- One for work schedules
- One for kids' activities

## Troubleshooting

### Events Not Showing

1. Make sure your calendar integration is working correctly
2. Check that the entity ID is correct
3. Verify that the calendar has events in the current month
4. Check the Home Assistant logs for errors

### Colors Not Applied

Make sure you're using valid hex color codes (e.g., `#FF6B6B`, not `red`)

### Card Not Loading

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Check browser console for errors (F12)
3. Verify the resource is properly added to Lovelace

### Cannot Create Events

1. Verify `enable_event_management: true` in your configuration
2. Check that the calendar is not in the `readonly_calendars` list
3. Ensure the calendar integration supports event creation
4. Check Home Assistant logs for service call errors

### Cannot Edit or Delete Events

If you don't see Edit or Delete buttons on events:

1. **Google Calendar Users**: The Google Calendar integration **does not support** editing or deleting events through Home Assistant. This is a limitation of the integration itself, not this card. You must use the Google Calendar app or website to modify events.

2. **Check Calendar Support**: Not all calendar integrations support editing/deleting
   - Local Calendar: Supports deletion (editing uses delete+create)
   - CalDAV: Varies by server implementation
   - Office 365: Varies by setup

3. **Check Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   enable_event_management: true  # Must be enabled
   readonly_calendars: []  # Calendar should not be in this list
   ```

4. **Missing UID**: Some events may not have a UID field, which is required for editing/deleting

### Google Calendar: "Please use the Google Calendar app or website"

This is **expected behavior**. The Home Assistant Google Calendar integration does not expose the services needed to edit or delete events. This is a limitation of the integration.

**Solutions:**
- **To edit/delete**: Use the official Google Calendar app or https://calendar.google.com
- **To create**: You can still create events through this card - they will appear in Google Calendar
- **Alternative**: Use a Local Calendar or CalDAV calendar if you need full editing support in Home Assistant

### Edit/Delete Fails with "Calendar does not support modifications"

This means:
- The calendar integration doesn't expose the UPDATE or DELETE services
- The event doesn't have a UID (required for modifications)
- The calendar is marked as read-only in your configuration

**Workaround**: You can manually delete/recreate events through the calendar integration's native interface.

### "No writable calendars available" Error

This means all your calendars are either:
- Read-only (in the `readonly_calendars` list)
- Don't support event creation

**Solution:**
1. Remove calendars from `readonly_calendars` list
2. Verify your calendar integration supports creation
3. Add a Local Calendar for testing
